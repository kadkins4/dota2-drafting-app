> A DOTA 2 drafting app

## What is DOTA 2?
> A 5v5 strategy game, where players control, in most cases, one unit to try to destroy the opposing team's ancient (base).  The game has over 100 heroes, is free-to-play, and no game is ever the same. One of the most important facets of teh game begins before the actual playing starts. This is the draft... where teams will choose the 5 heroes they will play with for the next 20 minutes to possibly over an hour. The draft can win you the game or ultimately be your downfall.  Practice your strats and counterpicking here! :)
